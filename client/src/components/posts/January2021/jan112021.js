                <p className="blogBody"> The story of how I decided to take a coding bootcamp probably began like many others. I had graduated from a University years ago in a completely unrelated field that I was going nowhere fast in, I had always had a little interest in technology but never studied it, I had heard just how much money you could make as a programmer which really caught my attention, and I tried real hard to learn programming on my own with not much success.
                    I spent about 4 years attempting to learn programming on and off on my own, however I started with zero experience in programming so I had no idea where to start. I started googling everything related to programming, I watched tutorials on everything I could on youtube, I downloaded apps to learn when I wasn't around my computer, and took any free class on websites such as coursera, freecodecamp, udemy, etc. I made progress,
                    but very slow progress, and I had no real help which caused me to spend hours on simple things when I would get stuck. This process was taking way too long so I finally took the plunge into bootcamp this past year.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    The bootcamp I signed up for was a six month part-time coding bootcamp with a focus on web development through Trilogy with the University of Miami. One of the reasons I signed up for this bootcamp was because I really did not know many people in the field so I wanted to be around people with a similar mindset and goals as I had. I also thought this could be a good way to network in the field. However luckily for me the class started the same month that we began a global pandemic and everything went remote.
                    Well that messed up those plans but I still needed another way to advance in this new career I had chosen so I stuck with it. I did a lot of research before signing up and I have seen mixed feelings about bootcamps in general so I wanted to give my thoughts on it.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Let me start by saying I came out of the experience with a very positive experience of bootcamps in general. Let me give the positives and negatives that I have experienced and come up with about bootcamps in general.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    <h3><u>Positives</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You get structure.</li>
                        <li>Networking with people in the field.</li>
                        <li>You learn what is expected in the field.</li>
                        <li>Career help.</li>
                        <li>Motivation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3><u>Negatives</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cost.</li>
                        <li>Time consuming.</li>
                        <li>You don't necessarily get a job after graduation.</li>
                        <li>There's too much to learn everything you need to know in the class.</li>
                        <li>There are many people graduating with the same skills as you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br></br>
                    The success you find from a bootcamp really depends on your mindset going into it. Even though I listed some negatives they really can be picked apart quite easily.
                    Every bootcamp I've seen is expensive, however so is a four year college which likely gives you less real world skills than your bootcamp classes. So you can put it off or decide not to do it,
                    but then wouldn't you be putting off a higher paying career longer also which would have evened out the cost of taking it earlier? This brings me to another point, don't expect to just get a job 
                    after the bootcamp. You do have to put in the work, I've found that the career advisers do a lot to try to help out but they really can only do so much. They've sent me job leads that don't really go
                    anywhere so I've still had to do most of the search on my own. You will still find a lot of companies who want actual real work experience, but that's the same in any career anyways.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    A bootcamp really is time consuming, and you need to expect that. But that's the same as when trying to learn any new skill. I took a part time bootcamp, whereas I had a regular full-time job and 
                    took my classes at night throughout the week. We had two weeknights with a three hour class and a four hour class on Saturday. I saw so many people in my class get overwhelmed and quit part way through 
                    because they did not go all in on the bootcamp. They tried to take shortcuts and balance it with the rest of their lives. If you're not prepared to put in the time then you might as well not waste the 
                    money, you won't make it through. There's way too much information and the bootcamp moves way too fast which will eventually cause you to fall behind, which brings me to my next point. There is a lot of information, 
                    but it doesn't cover everything. Since I've graduated I realized there was a lot I still did not know and have had to continuously learn since then. Even on the subject I specifically went for. There's just too much, so don't expect to 
                    know everything upon graduating. Something else I have noticed is a lot of these bootcamps teach the same skills over and over, which seems to me like it'll eventually over-saturate the market, but that's 
                    why I would recommend branching out and learning other similar skills on your own after the bootcamp to help you to stand out. They should be easier to get the hang of after you get the hang of the skills being taught.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    For anybody really on the fence about whether they should take a bootcamp or just try to learn on their own, I do have to point out how helpful it was to have some structure from the bootcamp. 
                    I was learning things on my own but I didn't really understand it or know how to put it all together. Throughout the bootcamp I had so many "Ah Ha!" moments about things I'd been working through on my own I felt that made it worth it. 
                    I never really knew exactly how to start something from scratch and deploy it either. The bootcamp simplified all of it, and while it can still be complicated for certain things I can much easier figure it out now. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Of everything I've mentioned I do think the most helpful thing bootcamps do is gear itself towards you actually working in the field. I got two four year degrees before taking a bootcamp and neither of them taught you like 
                    you were going to be working in the field. They essentially just taught the knowledge of the subject, but not how to use it in the real world. The main reason I think highly of bootcamps is because they specifically teach you what 
                    an employer would be looking for and how to use your skills in the field.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Another big advantage of joining a bootcamp is the motivation and networking that comes with being around like minded people and learning with them. There's a difference about the mental aspects between trying to learn on your own 
                    and trying to learn with other people. I know for me personally I would start feeling like I would never learn this stuff, that it seems so easy for everybody else and I would start putting them on a pedestal, and I would end up 
                    taking long breaks after trying to learn for six months at a time or so. Once you're around other likeminded people you realize you're probably around the same level as most people, especially when your instructors have difficulty 
                    figuring something out right away. It's a little easier on your mental health when going through this process, especially if you don't already have a mentor.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I'm not being paid by any bootcamp and this isn't even necessarily a review on them. I spent about two years debating on whether to jump into one or not and I kept telling myself oh it's real expensive and I can just do it on my own, which is definitely possible. 
                    There's more than enough information out there to learn what you need to on your own and lots of people have done it. But at the same time I feel like I could have saved a lot of time and stress if I had just decided to jump in and do it. I do recommend at least having a high level knowledge of 
                    programming beforehand, it's not necessary but it does make things so much easier since every single subject isn't brand new. You get to relax and focus on what you don't know. Life is short and moves quickly so if you're serious about moving into this career 
                    and have spent a couple months trying to learn on your own with little to no progress I want to write this post to give my recommendation of what finally got me over the hump.
