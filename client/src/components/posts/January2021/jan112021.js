            <p className="blogBody"> The story of how I decided to take a coding bootcamp probably began like many others. I had graduated from a University years ago in a completely unrelated field that I was going nowhere fast in, I had always had a little interest in technology but never studied it, I had heard just how much money you could make as a programmer which really caught my attention, and I tried real hard to learn programming on my own with not much success.
                I spent about 4 years attempting to learn programming on and off on my own, however I started with zero experience in programming so I had no idea where to start. I started googling everything related to programming, I watched tutorials on everything I could on youtube, I downloaded apps to learn when I wasn't around my computer, and took any free class on websites such as coursera, freecodecamp, udemy, etc. I made progress,
                but very slow progress, and I had no real help which caused me to spend hours on simple things when I would get stuck. This process was taking way too long so I finally took the plunge into bootcamp this past year.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The bootcamp I signed up for was a coding bootcamp with a focus on web development. One of the reasons I signed up for this bootcamp was because I really did not know many people in the field so I wanted to be around people with a similar mindset and goals as I had. I also thought this could be a good way to network in the field. However luckily for me the class started the same month that we began a global pandemic and everything went remote.
                Well that messed up those plans but I still needed another way to advance in this new career I had chosen so I stuck with it. I did a lot of research before signing up and I have seen mixed feelings about bootcamps in general so I wanted to give my thoughts on it.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Let me start by saying I came out of the experience with a very positive experience of bootcamps in general. Let me give the positives and negatives that I have experienced and come up with about bootcamps in general.
